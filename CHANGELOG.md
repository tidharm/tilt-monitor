# Changelog

<hr/><h1 tag="1.1.2" date="2025-07-09">v1.1.2</h1>

**Tilt Monitor** is now packaged and released as a Disk Image (`Tilt-Monitor-x.x.x.dmg`), so you can install it natively on macOS (you can still install from sources like before if you prefer though).  

<img src="resources/readme/dmg-installation.png" alt="Disk Image Installation" height="250" style="vertical-align:middle;"><br/>

**Note:** This app is not signed by Apple, so when installing via Disk Image, macOS GateKeeper might prevent you from launching it.  
If that happens, you'll need to allow it either manually via **System Settings** >> **Privacy & Security**, or, by removing the quarantine attribute via command line:  
```shell
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Tilt Monitor.app"
```

<hr/><h1 tag="1.0.5" date="2025-06-30">v1.0.5</h1>

Add support for configuration of custom environment variables, that are required but missing from the vanilla env spun up by the app.

**Example:**

# Tilt Monitor
![menubar-main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819d5bdb-3080-466f-a2fa-ddefc331b9b4)


Tilt Monitor is a macOS menu bar application that provides real-time status monitoring for [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/).  

It replicates Tilt's favicon status colors, and allows you basic control over Tilt's status (start/stop), as well as quick access to the Tilt dashboard to view your resources.

## Features

- **Dynamic Menu Bar Icon**: Real-time status monitoring with a dynamically colored icon that reflects the state of your Tilt environment.
- **Graceful Process Management**: Starts and stops the Tilt daemon gracefully using `tilt up` and `tilt down`.
- **Easy Configuration**: Configure the app via a simple JSON file, with a menu option to open it directly.
